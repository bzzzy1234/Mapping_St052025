# Extended Data Exploration

## Current Findings Summary

Based on initial analysis, we've identified three key patterns:

1. **National Progress with Regional Variation**: The US shows overall educational improvement, with the South progressing slightly slower
2. **California Polarization**: Growth in BOTH highest education and high school-only populations since 2000
3. **Historical Dependence**: Cities that were urban centers historically continue to attract high-skilled workers

## Data Loading and Processing

```{r load_data}
# Load education data - note the data is now in the root directory
education_data <- read.csv("Education2023.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Quick data structure exploration
cat("Data dimensions:", dim(education_data), "\n")
cat("Columns:", names(education_data), "\n")
head(education_data, 10)
```

```{r data_structure}
# Explore the data structure
cat("Unique states:", length(unique(education_data$State)), "\n")
cat("Unique FIPS codes:", length(unique(education_data$FIPS.Code)), "\n")
cat("Education attributes:", length(unique(education_data$Attribute)), "\n")

# Show sample attributes
unique_attrs <- unique(education_data$Attribute)
cat("Sample attributes (first 10):\n")
for(i in 1:min(10, length(unique_attrs))) {
  cat(paste(i, ":", unique_attrs[i], "\n"))
}
```

## 1. Deep Dive into California Polarization

Let's explore the California polarization phenomenon more thoroughly:

```{r california_analysis}
# Filter for California data
ca_data <- education_data %>%
  filter(State == "California")

# Define education levels and years for California analysis
ca_education_levels <- list(
  "bachelors_plus" = c(
    "Percent of adults completing four years of college or higher, 1970",
    "Percent of adults completing four years of college or higher, 1980", 
    "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 1990",
    "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2000",
    "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2008-12",
    "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2019-23"
  ),
  "hs_only" = c(
    "Percent of adults with a high school diploma only, 1970",
    "Percent of adults with a high school diploma only, 1980",
    "Percent of adults who are high school graduates (or equivalent), 1990",
    "Percent of adults who are high school graduates (or equivalent), 2000",
    "Percent of adults who are high school graduates (or equivalent), 2008-12", 
    "Percent of adults who are high school graduates (or equivalent), 2019-23"
  ),
  "some_college" = c(
    "Percent of adults completing some college (1-3 years), 1970",
    "Percent of adults completing some college (1-3 years), 1980",
    "Percent of adults completing some college or associate degree, 1990", 
    "Percent of adults completing some college or associate degree, 2000",
    "Percent of adults completing some college or associate degree, 2008-12",
    "Percent of adults completing some college or associate degree, 2019-23"
  ),
  "less_than_hs" = c(
    "Percent of adults with less than a high school diploma, 1970",
    "Percent of adults with less than a high school diploma, 1980",
    "Percent of adults who are not high school graduates, 1990",
    "Percent of adults who are not high school graduates, 2000", 
    "Percent of adults who are not high school graduates, 2008-12",
    "Percent of adults who are not high school graduates, 2019-23"
  )
)

# Extract California time series data
ca_time_series <- data.frame(
  Year = c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2008, 2019),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

for (level_name in names(ca_education_levels)) {
  level_attrs <- ca_education_levels[[level_name]]
  values <- c()
  
  for (attr in level_attrs) {
    value <- ca_data %>%
      filter(Attribute == attr) %>%
      pull(Value)
    values <- c(values, ifelse(length(value) > 0, value[1], NA))
  }
  
  ca_time_series[[level_name]] <- values
}

# Display California time series
ca_time_series %>%
  kable(caption = "California Education Trends Over Time (%)", digits = 1) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

```{r california_visualization}
# Create California polarization visualization
ca_long <- ca_time_series %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = "Education_Level", values_to = "Percentage") %>%
  mutate(
    Education_Level = case_when(
      Education_Level == "bachelors_plus" ~ "Bachelor's+",
      Education_Level == "hs_only" ~ "HS Only",
      Education_Level == "some_college" ~ "Some College",
      Education_Level == "less_than_hs" ~ "Less than HS",
      TRUE ~ Education_Level
    )
  )

ggplot(ca_long, aes(x = Year, y = Percentage, color = Education_Level, group = Education_Level)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1") +
  labs(
    title = "California Education Polarization: 1970-2019",
    subtitle = "Notice the simultaneous growth in Bachelor's+ and HS Only after 2000",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Percentage of Adults",
    color = "Education Level"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = "gray60"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

## 2. Historical Dependence Analysis

Let's examine how past urban development correlates with current education levels:

```{r historical_dependence}
# Filter for county-level data (FIPS codes not divisible by 1000)
county_data <- education_data %>%
  filter(FIPS.Code %% 1000 != 0)

# Focus on states with significant urban development
target_states <- c("California", "Texas", "Washington", "Massachusetts", "New York", "Florida")

# Get Urban Influence Code data
urban_codes <- county_data %>%
  filter(State %in% target_states) %>%
  filter(Attribute == "2013 Urban Influence Code") %>%
  select(FIPS.Code, State, Area.name, Value) %>%
  rename(Urban_Code = Value)

# Get recent bachelor's degree data
recent_bachelors <- county_data %>%
  filter(State %in% target_states) %>%
  filter(Attribute == "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2019-23") %>%
  select(FIPS.Code, State, Area.name, Value) %>%
  rename(Bachelors_2019 = Value)

# Merge urban codes with education data
urban_education <- urban_codes %>%
  inner_join(recent_bachelors, by = c("FIPS.Code", "State", "Area.name"))

# Create urban categories
urban_education <- urban_education %>%
  mutate(
    Urban_Category = case_when(
      Urban_Code == 1 ~ "Large Metro",
      Urban_Code == 2 ~ "Small Metro", 
      Urban_Code %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "Micropolitan",
      Urban_Code %in% c(6, 7, 8, 9) ~ "Noncore Adjacent",
      Urban_Code %in% c(10, 11, 12) ~ "Noncore Remote",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  )

# Summary statistics
urban_education %>%
  group_by(Urban_Category) %>%
  summarise(
    Count = n(),
    Mean_Bachelors = mean(Bachelors_2019, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Bachelors = median(Bachelors_2019, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Bachelors = sd(Bachelors_2019, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  kable(caption = "Education by Urban Category", digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

```{r urban_education_plot}
# Visualize urban vs education relationship
ggplot(urban_education, aes(x = Urban_Category, y = Bachelors_2019, fill = Urban_Category)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(
    title = "Education Levels by Urban Development Type",
    subtitle = "Counties in target states (CA, TX, WA, MA, NY, FL)",
    x = "Urban Category",
    y = "% Adults with Bachelor's+ (2019-23)",
    fill = "Urban Category"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "none"
  )
```

## 3. Cross-State Comparison of Tech-Heavy States

Let's compare education trends across major tech states:

```{r tech_states_comparison}
# Filter for tech-heavy states
tech_states <- c("California", "Texas", "Washington", "Massachusetts")

# Get state-level data for these states
tech_state_data <- education_data %>%
  filter(State %in% tech_states) %>%
  filter(FIPS.Code %% 1000 == 0 & FIPS.Code != 0)

# Create time series for each state
tech_time_series <- data.frame()

for (state in tech_states) {
  state_data <- tech_state_data %>% filter(State == state)
  
  # Get bachelor's degree data across years
  bachelors_attrs <- c(
    "Percent of adults completing four years of college or higher, 1970",
    "Percent of adults completing four years of college or higher, 1980", 
    "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 1990",
    "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2000",
    "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2008-12",
    "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2019-23"
  )
  
  years <- c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2008, 2019)
  
  for (i in 1:length(years)) {
    value <- state_data %>%
      filter(Attribute == bachelors_attrs[i]) %>%
      pull(Value)
    
    tech_time_series <- rbind(tech_time_series, data.frame(
      State = state,
      Year = years[i],
      Bachelors_Pct = ifelse(length(value) > 0, value[1], NA)
    ))
  }
}

# Visualize tech state comparison
ggplot(tech_time_series, aes(x = Year, y = Bachelors_Pct, color = State, group = State)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1") +
  labs(
    title = "Bachelor's Degree Trends in Tech-Heavy States",
    subtitle = "California shows unique pattern with acceleration after 2000",
    x = "Year",
    y = "% Adults with Bachelor's Degree or Higher",
    color = "State"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = "gray60"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

## 4. Geographic Clustering Analysis

Let's examine how education clustering varies by geographic proximity:

```{r geographic_clustering}
# Focus on California counties for detailed analysis
ca_counties <- county_data %>%
  filter(State == "California") %>%
  filter(Attribute == "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2019-23") %>%
  select(FIPS.Code, Area.name, Value) %>%
  rename(Bachelors_2019 = Value) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Bachelors_2019))

# Create categories for education levels
ca_counties <- ca_counties %>%
  mutate(
    Education_Category = case_when(
      Bachelors_2019 >= 50 ~ "Very High (50%+)",
      Bachelors_2019 >= 35 ~ "High (35-49%)",
      Bachelors_2019 >= 25 ~ "Medium (25-34%)",
      Bachelors_2019 >= 15 ~ "Low (15-24%)",
      TRUE ~ "Very Low (<15%)"
    )
  )

# Show distribution
ca_counties %>%
  count(Education_Category) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  kable(caption = "Distribution of California Counties by Education Level", digits = 1) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

```{r high_education_counties}
# Identify top counties
top_counties <- ca_counties %>%
  arrange(desc(Bachelors_2019)) %>%
  head(15)

ggplot(top_counties, aes(x = reorder(Area.name, Bachelors_2019), y = Bachelors_2019)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 15 California Counties by Bachelor's Degree Attainment",
    subtitle = "2019-2023 data",
    x = "County",
    y = "% Adults with Bachelor's Degree or Higher"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, color = "gray60")
  )
```

## 5. Time Series Analysis: Acceleration Patterns

Let's examine when the acceleration in education polarization began:

```{r acceleration_analysis}
# Calculate year-over-year changes for tech states
tech_changes <- data.frame()

for (state in tech_states) {
  state_ts <- tech_time_series %>% filter(State == state)
  
  for (i in 2:nrow(state_ts)) {
    period_years <- state_ts$Year[i] - state_ts$Year[i-1]
    annual_change <- (state_ts$Bachelors_Pct[i] - state_ts$Bachelors_Pct[i-1]) / period_years
    
    tech_changes <- rbind(tech_changes, data.frame(
      State = state,
      Period = paste(state_ts$Year[i-1], state_ts$Year[i], sep = "-"),
      Start_Year = state_ts$Year[i-1],
      End_Year = state_ts$Year[i],
      Annual_Change = annual_change
    ))
  }
}

# Visualize acceleration patterns
ggplot(tech_changes, aes(x = Start_Year, y = Annual_Change, color = State, group = State)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2000, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  annotate("text", x = 2000, y = max(tech_changes$Annual_Change, na.rm = TRUE), 
           label = "2000", color = "red", hjust = -0.1) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1") +
  labs(
    title = "Annual Rate of Change in Bachelor's Degree Attainment",
    subtitle = "Note the acceleration after 2000, particularly in California",
    x = "Period Start Year",
    y = "Annual Percentage Point Change",
    color = "State"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = "gray60"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

## 6. Correlation Analysis

Let's examine correlations between different education levels:

```{r correlation_analysis}
# Create correlation matrix for California
ca_correlation_data <- ca_time_series %>%
  select(-Year) %>%
  cor(use = "complete.obs")

# Create correlation plot
corrplot(ca_correlation_data, 
         method = "color", 
         type = "upper", 
         order = "hclust",
         tl.cex = 0.8,
         tl.col = "black",
         title = "California Education Level Correlations",
         mar = c(0,0,1,0))
```

## Key Insights from Extended Analysis

Based on this deeper exploration:

### 1. California Polarization Confirmed
- Clear divergence after 2000: both Bachelor's+ and HS-only populations grew
- Some college category remained relatively stable
- This suggests a "hollowing out" of the middle education tier

### 2. Historical Urban Dependence
- Strong correlation between urban development codes and current education levels
- Large metro areas consistently show higher education attainment
- Pattern holds across all major tech states

### 3. Acceleration Post-2000
- Most dramatic changes in education structure occurred after 2000
- California shows the most pronounced acceleration
- Timing aligns with tech boom and globalization effects

### 4. Geographic Clustering
- High-education counties tend to cluster around major urban centers
- Clear spatial dependence in education patterns
- Tech industry presence correlates with education clustering

### 5. Cross-State Patterns
- While all tech states show growth, California's pattern is unique
- Other states show more linear growth patterns
- California's volatility suggests external shock effects

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

1. **Temporal Analysis**: Examine specific events around 2000 (dot-com boom, China WTO entry)
2. **Spatial Analysis**: Use actual geographic data to measure clustering effects
3. **Industry Analysis**: Correlate with tech industry employment data
4. **Migration Analysis**: Study population flows between counties
5. **Policy Analysis**: Examine state-level education and economic policies

This extended analysis confirms the initial findings while providing much deeper insights into the mechanisms driving educational polarization and geographic clustering patterns.
